<!--
Currently, core-style renders provided styles *immediately* upon creation if
they have textContent (or async if not). Unfortunately for us, that makes it
difficult to configure AND provide styles within the same element.

We need to be able to defer the rendering of styles until _after_ the
`paper-theme` element has been fully constructed - and has injected its theme
configuration.

Because paper-theme knows which styles are used (global, and elements), we can
also allow it to render only those styles that are needed. Basically, we just
skip calling `provide`. It is up to paper-theme to call `provide` when it is
ready.

TODO(imac): What's the _real_ solution here? sorvell@ probably has ideas.
